# TDD Workshop

Collection of TDD katas.

## Fizz Buzz

### Goal

For this project we would like you to design a program to recreate the FizzBuzz numbers game.

#### Rules

For the integers 1 through 100 inclusive program should:

- return Fizz for any multiple of 3
- return Buzz for any multiple of 5
- return FizzBuzz for any multiple of 3 & 5
- return the integer that was input if none of the above are true

## Rock Paper Scissors Kata

The game of Rock-Paper-Scissors is simple: Rock beats Scissors, Scissors beats Paper, Paper beats Rock.

### Rules

Your task is to create the core logic that checks which gesture wins in a matchup. For example:

| Gesture 1 | Gesture 2 | Result              |
| --------- | --------- | ------------------- |
| rock      | scissors  | rock beats scissors |
| paper     | rock      | paper beats rock    |

... and so on. Good luck!
